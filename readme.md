# EC-TEL Proceedings Data Analysis

Data analysis conducted for [TIDE Research Group of Interactive and Distributed Technologies for Education (UPF)](https://www.upf.edu/web/tide).

This analysis explores the gender diversity of authors of the papers and presentations of the [European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning (EC-TEL)](http://www.ec-tel.eu/) conferences and proceedings.

The data was gathered from the proceedings books available on the conference's website.

- We used binary values for gender: male and female authors;</li>
- Fields of research and work were separated in two (2) broad categories: engineering and social sciences;</li>
- For simplicity's sake, we only used the first university or institution mentioned when a researcher/academic listed more than one in their credit.</li>
